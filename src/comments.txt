- is I need only for basic arcs? 
- need for calc_X_flows??? Is calcX enough???
- Different structure for J_ => faster calc_logos?
- How to renew J_????
-Check renewal of basic tree
-Check renewal of xij
-Check renewal of sij. No need to recalculate wi
-Check renewal of dij
- Cycling????? In the code I put into I+ all the arcs that hve the same negative flow (lines 266-... in dnepca.c)
	With seed=422235123,NODES=30,DENSITY=70, sources 15, sinks 14, tsources 1 
	in repeatetions 21-22 ekfylismeni(;)
v6.3
- a small change in calc_X_flows() (no need to check the non basic arcs)

v6.2
- Try to compute J_ in a different way: Instead of keeping all in array J_ (containing 0 or 1) 
I tried to only maintain the indexes of arcs really belonging into J_ and search among them. It worked BUT
it takes more time....
	
v5.6.5
- renew D vector
	
v5.6.2
- a small change into calc_J (no need to check if basic)
	
v5.6.1
- Write better getsumh
	
v5.6
+ deleted some no needed variables
	
v5.5
+ uses find_theta instead pf find_thetas	

v5.4
+ I removed exerx_toxo etx. information	
	
	
v5.0 
Implement Dual Network Simplex	
	
v4.0
- Print nothing!! Commented checks etc. so that it takes less time to execute!!!	
	
v3.3
- Calculates cpu time	
	
v3.1
Added the ability to store many graphs into a directory
Added main.c
Added multi generate and store graphs
Added multi solve graphs

v2.3
Same as 2.2 but more clearly writen and corrected

v2.2
- Check J_ behaviour and find directions dij and flow tij (which is dual feasible)

v2.1 
- Calculates difference Dz between the new and previous objective value. It is Dz=theta*c_enteringarc=theta*Sum(tij*cij)
- Check type-A pivots and type-B pivots (entering arc's  flow, s_leavingarc etc...)

v2.0
- Actually the same as v1.9.2.
- In Aggelos' examples it does not obtain an initial dual feasible solution (bug in dualtree function?)


v1.9.2
- The only difference compared to version 1.9 is that method dnepsa() has a parameter objval that returns the objective value.

v1.9.1
- The only thing that 1.9.1 does is to compare the solutions found when renewing sets I_,I+ against
the solutions found when these sets are calculating from scratch.So I made 2 methods dnepsa() and 
dnepsa1() where the one renews sets I_,I+ and the 2nd calculates them from scratch.
- I changed methods dnepsa() and dnepsa1() to have a parameter objval that returns the objective value.
- In order to make them give same results I changed the renewal methos. The problem was that when 
we had more than one arc having the same negative flow and one of them was chosen to be the leaving arc,
then the others remained in I_. To avoid this problem I made the program to check the arcs having
flow 0 (the new flows calculated) and put them into I+
v1.9
- Add new main and make dnepsa function. The new main can produce different seeds in order to test the program...
dnepsa() Returns 0 if the solution is primal feasible and dual feasible
 Returns 1 if the solution is primal feasible but not dual feasible
 Returns 2 if the solution is not primal feasible and dual feasible
 Returns 3 if the solution is not primal feasible and not dual feasible
 Returns 4 if the graph is disconnected
 Returns 5 if the problem is infeasible
 Returns -1 if it doesn't find an initial dual feasible solution

- add test_dnepsa function that test the algorithm for a number (loop) of different problems (different seeds)
- add function isekfyl that checks the flow and returns 1 if it is ekfylismeni

v1.8.1
- Change the way I_ and I+ are renewed. (in case it is th1<=th2 then I[i]=1...)

v1.8
- Make array I to contain DENSITY elements where it is -1 for I_
 and +1 for I+ and 0 is non-basic. 
- So, functions calc_I, print_I etc has been changed. 
- Function get_index added to give the index of an arc in FROM[] TO[] structures
- Functions find_th1, find_th2 changed in order to return the above index (it is named index_i) 

v1.7.1
new: 
use double instead of float for logos, s[] and t[]

v1.7
- Calculate D direction and then values t[i]=s[i]+a*D[i] where a=logos. i.e. t gives a sequence of 
dual variables that are always dual feasible.
- Changed the way I_ and I+ are formes. I_ contains the non-basic arcs where sij<0 and I+ the non-basic arcs where 
sij>=0. 
- Better comments
- Better printings
- No need for ptint_basic_tree (Use of print_tree instead)



DNEPSA v1.6
- Tha prospathisw na allaxw ton kanona me ta th1, tha2. Diladi na min ypologizontai
apo tin arxi ta I_ kai ta I+ alla na ananewnontai...


DNEPSA v1.5

- Made the program to print into files the program in array format i.e. arrays
A,b,c of the linear format in order to use them from Matlab (macro file dases)
- A #define SHOW_ITER is added. When 1 it waits after each iteration for Enter.
- It seems in some cases (Aggelos instances) the algorithm does not find an initial
dual feasible solution. The algorithm stops in that case print a message (returns -1)

STRANGE: When I run the program for bug1 it gives an optimal solution (1393) after 461(?)
iterations BUT it is not dual feasible (not s>=0).
If I save tha arrays (A,B,c,supplies) and load them to Matlab then dases gives an optimal
solution (and dual feasible) but it takes a little more iterations.
On the other hand dases1 does not run!!! (it stores NaN values to  x,y, etc)

DNEPSA v1.4

I just changes find_th1 and find_th2 functions. In tha place where they find the minimum I
put <= instead of <. It seems to work ok for the bug in hte program of 20 nodes x 50 arcs
but it does not work for Aggelos' instances.
- TO: It seems there is a bug to find correct results when using Aggelos' instances
